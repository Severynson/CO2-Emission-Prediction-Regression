## 🚗 CO₂ Emissions Prediction Project

A two-notebook machine learning workflow for both explainability and high-accuracy prediction

This project explores and predicts CO₂ emissions of automobiles using machine learning.
It now consists of two separate notebooks, each serving a different purpose:

### 🧠 Notebook 1 — **dataset_analytics.ipynb**
Exploring the dataset + explainable modeling

This notebook focuses on understanding the structure, relationships, and underlying patterns of the CO₂ dataset.
Its goal is not to maximize predictive performance, but to use a highly interpretable model (Lasso regression) to uncover:
	• Which features most strongly influence CO₂ emissions
	• How engine size, vehicle class, fuel type, and transmission contribute to emissions
	• Whether regularization helps or harms interpretability
	• Whether the dataset contains noise or whether relationships are clean and stable

It includes:
✔ Data exploration
✔ Cleaning and leakage removal
✔ Categorical code decoding (transmission & fuel type)
✔ ColumnTransformer with one-hot encoding + numeric normalization
✔ Lasso models for multiple α values
✔ Coefficient analysis & visualizations
✔ Interpretation of real mechanical relationships

This notebook answers the why behind emissions patterns and provides an engineering-level understanding of the dataset.

### 🔧 Notebook 2 — **emissions_prediction.ipynb**

Training the best model for design-stage CO₂ prediction

This notebook focuses on building the most accurate predictive model for estimating emissions during the vehicle design stage.
Here, explainability is less important — the goal is robust accuracy.

It includes:

✔ Data preprocessing
✔ Train–test split
✔ ColumnTransformers for:
	• Linear + MLP models (one-hot + scaling)
	• Tree-based models (ordinal encoding)
✔ A unified Pipeline + GridSearchCV exploring:
	• Linear Regression (with polynomial features)
	• Ridge
	• SVR
	• Decision Trees
	• Random Forests
	• Gradient Boosting
	• MLP Neural Networks

✔ Cross-validated R² and RMSE comparisons
✔ Visualization of model performance
✔ Selection of the best-performing model
✔ Final evaluation on the test set
✔ Single-instance prediction example

Currently, RandomForestRegressor produces the strongest performance across both CV metrics and test evaluation.

This notebook answers the how:
How can we build the most accurate model for emissions prediction?

### 📌 Project Motivation
Automakers face increasing pressure to reduce emissions to meet regulatory standards and consumer demand for sustainable vehicles.
This project aims to provide a data-driven decision support tool that can be used even before a prototype is built.
	• Using these notebooks, engineers can:
	• Estimate emissions from early design specifications
	• Experiment with design alternatives
	• Optimize components to reduce emissions
	• Make more informed and eco-conscious decisions

### 📊 Features Used
Across both notebooks, the core features used for training include:
	• Engine Size (L)
	• Number of Cylinders
	• Vehicle Class
	• Transmission Type
	• Fuel Type

Fuel consumption columns are intentionally removed because they create data leakage: manufacturers cannot know these values prior to production.
